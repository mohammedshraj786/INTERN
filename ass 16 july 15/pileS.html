        Kalam took great care of his colleagues. A co-worker had promised his kids that he
        would take them to the science museum after returning from work, and obtained the
        prior permission of Mr. Kalam to leave early. The colleague was so engrossed in his
        work that it was well into the evening when he realised that he had made a promise to
        his kids. On rushing back home, he came to know from his wife that Mr. Kalam had
        come earlier and taken his kids to the museum.
        Great Human Being
        We were in a convoy of 6-7 cars. Dr. Kalam and I were in the second car. Ahead us was
        an open gypsy with three soldiers in it. Two of them were sitting on either side and one
        lean guy was standing atop, holding his gun. One hour into the road journey, Dr. Kalam
        said, "Why is he standing? He will get tired. This is like punishment. Can you ask a
        wireless message to given that he may sit?" I had to convince him, he has been
        probably instructed to keep standing for better security. He did not relent. We tried
        radio messaging, that did not work. For the next 1.5 hours of the journey, he reminded
        me thrice to see if I can hand signal him to sit down. Finally, realizing there is little we
        can do--he told me, "I want to meet him and thank him".
        "Later, when we landed in IIM Shillong, I went inquiring through security people and
        got hold of the standing guy. I took him inside and Dr. Kalam greeted him. He shook his
        hand, said thank you buddy. "Are you tired? Would you like something to eat? I am
        sorry you had to stand so long because of me". The young lean guard, draped in black
        cloth, was surprised at the treatment. He lost words, just said, "Sir, aapke liye to 6
        ghante bhi khade rahenge".
